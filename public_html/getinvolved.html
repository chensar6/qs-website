          <h5 class="w3-padding-32">We want to get people involved in and aware
            of the LGBTQ+ community, to make engineering at U of T a more
            welcoming and inclusive place for all. Does this sound like
            something you want to help accomplish? Then please join us in one of
            the ways below! </h5>

          <h7 class="w3-text-grey">Are you passionate but busy and not sure how
            much you can commit? No worries! We have ways for everyone to get
            involved as much or as little as they want! Not LGBTQ+? No problem!
            We believe allies are an important part of making change and

          <p class="w3-text-grey">The easiest way to get involved and keep up to
            date with what QueerSphere is up to is by <a
              href="http://queersphere.skule.ca/signup.html">joining our mailing
              list</a>!
            We try to get an email out about once a month plus an email to
            remind you of upcoming events. Too many emails already? Our <a
              href="queersphere.skule.ca/contactus.html">social media</a> is a
            good alternative to keep up to date as well!</p>

          <h1></h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Come to our Events!</h5>

          <p class="w3-text-grey">You don't need to join our mailiing list to
            enjoy our activities. Attending events is a great way to meet new
            friends, have fun with current ones, and celebrate who we are and
            our community!
            The best way to increase visibility and awareness of LGBTQ+
            engineers is to be visible at our events! You don't need to be queer
            to be welcome here, just be accepting and enjoy!</p>

          <p class="w3-text-grey">Want some volunteer hours? Maybe some
            volunteering perks? Or maybe you just want to help out when you can!
            Either way, our club is still growing and we can always use
            volunteers! You can sign-up on an event basis in forms listed in the
            event details or you can sign-up for a separate volunteering mailing
            list <a href>COMING SOON</a>!
            We offer volunteering at most of our major events!</p>

          <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Attend our meetings and help us plan!</h5>

          <p class="w3-text-grey">Our general meetings are where the magic
            happens; with event ideas, planning, general LGBTQ+ discussions, and
            access to free food! Attend as often or as little as you'd like and
            help us make this club come to life.
            We are hoping to eventually have monthly general meetings, with a
            few extra themed discussions throught each school year. Want to
            attend a specific meeting but can't make it in-person? Let us know
            ahead of time and we can remote you in.</p>
